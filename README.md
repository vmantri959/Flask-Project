Stock Tracker 
Stock Tracker is a watchlist I created for stocks and options
It allows the user to log in information about their stocks, such as the name, quantity and price they purchased it at and allows them to view the profit, current market value of that position, etc.

It also (in the future) will allow users to track options.
